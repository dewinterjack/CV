## Jack Dewinter

I am a software developer, keen on automation, especially for improving the process for other developers to release and produce high quality software. An interest in technology brought me to pursue my first year in Computer Science at Leeds, my drive to produce software led me to Makers Academy which excelled my development.

## Experience

**Systems Administrator at IPSA Medical** (July - September 2017)

I was given a large amount of freedom in my work. I was given many tasks that I found could be more efficient as an automated process. I set up new database software and programmed a data retrieval system, [placegen](https://github.com/dewinterjack/placegen), for a manager along with various other tools which could not be made public.

**Helpdesk Engineer at RockIT** (June - July 2016)

Assisting clients with IT problems, giving me a large amount of customer relations experience. I worked on-site, installing networks we designed for a client. 

**Teaching Assistant at BlueShift** (November 2015 - January 2016)

I assisted in teaching Javascript to kids over school breaks. I spent a lot of time 1 on 1 explaining challenging concepts in an understandable way. This is some of the most rewarding work I have done so far and always jump at an opportunity to teach.

**Film-maker at Gavsy Media** (September 2014 - February 2015)

I spent my time filming, managing equipment and editing the film that was captured. Every day I was communicating with my manager over requirements.

## Interests

**Ethics in Technology**

AI is a danger and I believe that if it is not developed in the correct way, there will be many devastating results. However, I think that if developed in a moral, careful manner it can follow a better path. I want to develop solutions that ensure AI, how our data is managed, biotech and other concerns in technology are dealt with correctly. I believe a large part of this process is through education

**Automation/DevOps**

I want to make the development process as smooth, efficient and enjoyable as possible. This involves educating best practices, automating arduous tasks and creating tools that are a bridge in development, not a hindrance.

**Augmented/Mixed Reality**

The way we interact with information is changing from screens to reality based retrieval. I want to develop technology that takes advantage of this new interface. I also want to be involved in the ethical questions that are raised by this shift in interaction with people and information.

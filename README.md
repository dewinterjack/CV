## Jack Dewinter

I am a software developer, keen on automation, especially for improving the process for other developers to release and produce high quality software. A keen interest in technology brought me to pursue my first year in Computer Science at Leeds, my drive to produce software led me to Makers Academy which excelled my development.

## Experience

**Systems Administrator at IPSA Medical** (July - September 2017)

I was given a large amount of freedom in my work. I was given many tasks that I found could be more efficient as an automated process. I set up new database software and programmed a data retreival system, [placegen](https://github.com/dewinterjack/placegen), for a manager along with various other tools which could not be made public.

**Helpdesk Engineer at RockIT** (June - July 2016)

Assisting clients with IT problems, giving me a large amount of customer relations experience. I worked on site, installing networks we designed for a client. 

**Teaching Assistant at BlueShift** (November 2015 - January 2016)

I assisted in teaching Javascript to kids over school breaks. I spent a lot of time 1 on 1 explaining challenging concepts in an understandable way. This is some of the most rewarding work I have done so far and always jump at an opportunity to teach.

**Film-maker at Gavsy Media** (September 2014 - February 2015)

I acted as a camera man, working with various equipment and ensuring actors or props were prepared. I spent most of my time editing the film that was captured and communicating with my manager over requirements.

## Interests

**Ethics in Technology**

AI is a dangerous super power, I believe that if it is not developed in the correct way, there will be many devastating results, however I think that if developed in a moral, careful manor it can follow a better path. I want to develop solutions that ensure AI, how our data is managed, biotech and other concerns in technology are dealt with correctly. I believe a large part of this process is through education.

**Automation/DevOps**

I want to make the development process as smooth, efficient and enjoyable as possible. This involves educating best practises, automating arduous tasks and creating tools that are a bridge in development, not a hinderence.

**Augmented/Mixed Reality**

The way we interact with information is changing from screens to reality based retreival. I want to develop technology that takes advantage of this new pallette. I also want to be involved in the ethical questions that are raised by this shift in interaction with people and information.

## Jack Dewinter

I am a software developer, committed to life-long learning. I am keen on automation and enabling developers to produce and release high quality software. My interest in technology led me to pursue my first year in Computer Science at Leeds; my drive to produce software led me to Makers Academy which propelled my development.

## Experience

**Dev & Systems Administrator at [IPSA Medical](https://ipsamedical.co.uk/)** (July - September 2017)

I automated various data storage and retrieval systems. I set up new database software and programmed a data retrieval system for potential clients using the Google Places API and various other APIs. - [Placegen](https://github.com/dewinterjack/placegen) in Python

**Helpdesk Engineer at [RockIT](https://www.rockit.co.uk/)** (June - July 2016)

I dealt with clients as first port of call for technical problems. Remotely accessed client computers to fix their issues, diagnosed and repaired computers sent in to the office and aided senior engineers in setting up office networks on site, including security precautions. Admin on Windows server for various clients.

**Teaching Assistant at [BlueShift](https://blueshiftcoding.com/)** (November 2015 - January 2016)

I assisted in teaching Javascript to kids over school breaks. I spent a lot of time 1 on 1 explaining challenging concepts in an understandable way. This is some of the most rewarding work I have done so far and I always jump at an opportunity to teach.

**Film-maker at [Gavsy Media](http://gavsymedia.co.uk/)** (September 2014 - February 2015)

I met with clients to establish requirements and then edited segments of film taken at their charity or private event. I also supported on-site filming for these events.  

 **Bloomberg, London** (July 2015)  

 Shadowed each department, learning how their news, data and analytics are dispersed around the world.  I spent most of my time with developers as they built their new system, which helped me learn about larger codebases.

 **Tech Course at Princeton University** (June - July 2013)

 I attended a summer program where I learned to build software, leveraging various programming languages, working alone and in teams and gaining key skills for working in the technology field. C++, Python and Java.

 **Myeloma UK**, London (2010 – present)

 I have been a volunteer for this national cancer charity since I was a teenager. My role here has included attending various events, greeting speakers and guests, participating in their appeal film, as well as raising funds. The funds raised have gone towards medical research to help find a cure for this rare cancer and has also helped to transform lives of the families affected.

 **Programming club**

 I wasn't satisfied with the programming education at my high school. I set up a club to learn python and basic web development. I encouraged other students to teach and the society continued running after I stopped teaching. I also helped with running the robotics club regularly.

## Interests

 **Automation/Abstraction**

 I want to make the development process as smooth, efficient and enjoyable as possible. This involves educating best practices, automating arduous tasks and creating tools that are a bridge in development, not a hindrance. I have become interested in abstraction software and would love to enable people to create more.

 **Ethics in Technology**

 I regularly follow technology news and like to keep up with recent developments. I want to help keep technology on a good path, I think that if good principles and guidelines are followed, AI and other technologies can be a benefit to society, not a hindrance.

 **Genealogy**

 I have been researching my family history for many years, collecting stories and travelling to interesting places and building my family tree along the way. I like solving puzzles which has enabled me to learn about my heritage and piece together my family's history.

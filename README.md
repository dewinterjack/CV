## Interests

**Ethics in Technology**

AI has its risks and I believe that if it is not developed in the correct way, there will dangerous results. However, I think that if developed in a moral, careful manner it can follow a better path. I want to develop solutions that ensure AI, how our data is managed, biotech and other concerns in technology are dealt with ethicly. I believe a large part of this process is through education

**Automation/DevOps**

I want to make the development process as smooth, efficient and enjoyable as possible. This involves educating best practices, automating arduous tasks and creating tools that are a bridge in development, not a hindrance.

**Genealogy**

I love puzzles. I have been researching my family history for many years. Collecting stories and travelling to interesting places, building my family tree along the way.

**Gaming**

I spend time gaming with friends around the world, I am a big fan of competetive esports such as League of Legends and Overwatch.

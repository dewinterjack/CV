## Jack Dewinter

I am a software developer, keen on automation, enabling developers to release and produce high quality software. An interest in technology brought me to pursue my first year in Computer Science at Leeds, my drive to produce software led me to Makers Academy which propelled my development.

## Interests

**Ethics in Technology**

AI has its risks and I believe that if it is not developed in the correct way, there will dangerous results. However, I think that if developed in a moral, careful manner it can follow a better path. I want to develop solutions that ensure AI, how our data is managed, biotech and other concerns in technology are dealt with ethicly. I believe a large part of this process is through education

**Automation/DevOps**

I want to make the development process as smooth, efficient and enjoyable as possible. This involves educating best practices, automating arduous tasks and creating tools that are a bridge in development, not a hindrance.

**Genealogy**

I have been researching my family history for many years. Collecting stories and travelling to interesting places, building my family tree along the way. I like solving puzzles and learning about my heritage and my interest has led me to interesting ideas and places.
